# Requests-BeautifulSoup
Web Scraping, or in Turkish, Veri KazÄ±ma, is a process carried out to extract information published on websites and organize this information in a manner suitable for the users' preferences. Websites are typically composed of HTML or XML codes, and these codes follow a specific structure. Data scraping is the process of extracting desired data from websites using these codes. This process can facilitate information gathering and analysis processes by providing automation to access information or by extracting data from large datasets for analysis. Data scraping is also referred to as web harvesting or web extraction.

Beautiful Soup is a Python library that is commonly used for web scraping purposes. It provides tools for pulling data out of HTML and XML files, and it is designed to make the process of web scraping easy and intuitive.

Here's a brief overview of how to use BeautifulSoup in Python for web scraping:

# Installation:
Before using BeautifulSoup, you need to install it. You can install it using the following command:

pip install beautifulsoup4

# Importing:
Import the BeautifulSoup class from the bs4 module:

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Fetching HTML:
You'll need to get the HTML content of the web page you want to scrape. You can use libraries like requests to make HTTP requests and get the HTML content.

import requests

```Python
url = "https://example.com"
response = requests.get(url)
html_content = response.text
```

# Creating a BeautifulSoup Object:
Create a BeautifulSoup object, specifying the HTML parser to be used:

soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')
The parser specified here is 'html.parser', but you can also use other parsers like 'lxml' or 'html5lib' based on your requirements.

# Navigating the HTML:
Use BeautifulSoup's methods to navigate and search the HTML tree. For example, to find all the links in the HTML, you can use the find_all method:

```Python
links = soup.find_all('a')
for link in links:
    print(link.get('href'))
```
This code snippet finds all the <a> (anchor) tags in the HTML and prints the values of their href attributes.
This is a basic introduction to using BeautifulSoup for web scraping in Python. Keep in mind that web scraping should be done in compliance with the website's terms of service, and you should check the legality of web scraping for the specific site you are targeting.
